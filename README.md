My realization of the test task.

## Features of the app

After the app launches User sees the login screen where he can put in his credentials (email, password).
There is a separate validation for email and password fields. 

After a successful login process, the app redirects the User to the main screen, where there is a list of alphabetically sorted cards (data was loaded from the Internet and locally sorted).
Any moment to refresh the list the User can swipe down.

There is a search realization in the app. To launch it, you need to press the button.

The drawer contains a user card with an avatar image, user name, email (data obtained from the Internet during the login process), and the log-out button (pressing the logout button redirects to the Login screen). 

The app supports dark and light mode.
